# Time series of AMOC Strength
Time series of AMOC strength

The work models the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) ocean current, measured at 26.5∘N. Data from the RAPID AMOC monitor- ing project is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and are freely available from www.rapid.ac.uk/rapidmoc. The dataset contains daily measurements of the AMOC strength between January 2010 and December 2020, measured in Sverdrups (Sv), where 1 Sv = 1 million cubic metres per second (1𝑆𝑣 = 106𝑚3𝑠−1).

The work will model AMOC Strength quarterly and monthly by SARIMA and Dynamic Linear Model, then predict the AMOC Strength in 2021, by quarter and by month respectively
